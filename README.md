## About Container Immersion

Many years ago, when [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was a relatively new
technology, I used [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn how to use
it. Git Immersion is based on the premise that the best way to learn a new
technology is by immersing yourself in it and *using it*.

Today, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a young technology. I found Git
Immersion such an effective tool for learning Git that I was inspired to create
a similar tutorial for Docker. I hope that Container Immersion can be as
effective for others as I found Git Immersion to be for me.
