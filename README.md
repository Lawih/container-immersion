# Container Immersion
üê≥ A tour that walks through the fundamentals of Docker.

Go to [**Container Immersion**](https://mkasberg.github.io/container-immersion).

## About Container Immersion

Many years ago, when [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was a relatively new
technology, I used [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn how to use
it. Git Immersion is based on the premise that the best way to learn a new
technology is by immersing yourself in it and *using it*.

Today, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a young technology. I found Git
Immersion such an effective tool for learning Git that I was inspired to create
a similar tutorial for Docker. I hope that Container Immersion can be as
effective for others as I found Git Immersion to be for me.

## Setup Dev Environment

 1. Clone the repository.
  `git clone git@github.com:mkasberg/container-immersion.git`
 2. Make sure Bundler is installed. `gem install bundler`
 3. Install Jekyll & dependencies. `cd container-immersion && bundle install
  --path vendor/bundle` (Path optional, but encouraged.)
 4. Run the site. `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can visit the site at
  [http://localhost:4000/container-immersion/](http://localhost:4000/container-immersion/).
  Essentially, this is just Jekyll. So read the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
  docs if you get stuck.

### About Jekyll

Container Immersion if built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static
site generator. When you run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, Jekyll will watch for
changes and continue regenerating the site and serving it from `_site` until you
hit `^C`. Don't edit the files in `_site` directly, since they are just
generated files.

### Project Structure

 - HTML layouts are at `_layouts`. We have a layout for the homepage, table of
   contents, and the lab pages.
 - These layouts can include HTML snippets from `_includes` (like the nav bar).
 - CSS is at `assets/css/immersion.scss`.
 - Each lab is a Markdown file at `_labs`. Jekyll converts it to a page using
   the `lab.html` layout.
