## About Docker Immersion

Many years ago, when [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was a relatively new
technology, I used [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) to learn how to use
it. Git Immersion is based on the premise that the best way to learn a new
technology is by immersing yourself in it and *using it*.

Today, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a young technology. I found Git
Immersion such an effective tool for learning Git that I was inspired to create
a similar tutorial for Docker. I hope that Docker Immersion can be as effective
for others as I found Git Immersion to be for me.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. I'm currently developing this site pretty actively, so
make sure your changes won't conflict with the direction we're heading.

### Setup Dev Environment

 1. Clone the repository.
  `git clone git@github.com:mkasberg/docker-immersion.git`
 2. Make sure Bundler is installed. `gem install bundler`
 3. Install Jekyll & dependencies. `cd docker-immersion && bundle install
  --path vendor/bundle` (Path optional, but encouraged.)
 4. Run the site. `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You can visit the site at
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). Essentially, this is just
  Jekyll. So read the Jekyll docs if you get stuck.
